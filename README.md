# Embedded-Systems-Programming

The repository contains two projects and are solving different problems. Project one turns the TI SimpleLink CC3220S microcontroller into a morse code device. Two buttons are used to blink the LED lights with the words SOS or OK depending on which button is pressed. This application can be used to save lives. This can help people communicate in a non-verbal way.

Project two creates a thermostat with the TI SimpleLink CC3220S microcontroller. This project uses the onboard sensors to read temperature. The temperature is increased or decreased with the use of buttons on the microcontroller. The red LED indicates heat and is triggered when the temperature sensor reads lower than the setpoint to raise the temperature.

Both projects I was able to achieve the correct functionality. I was able to integrate the drivers and have the sensors communicate with the software.
Project improvements can be made by integrating more features. New releases to ensure the code is up to date and debugged. The resources used in this project are from the Zybook Emerging Systems Architectures & Technologies. www.zybooks.com

Understanding how timers and interrupts work with embedded systems can be useful and applied to other applications. Applying drivers to allow the hardware components to become functional. This concept applies to computer systems.

The projects follow coding best practices to ensure maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. Code commenting consist throughout the code to ensure readability. Thorough testing and debugging processes ensure quality.
